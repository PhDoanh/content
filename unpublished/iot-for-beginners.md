## The Genesis of Connectedness: What is the Internet of Things?

The term 'Internet of Things' was first coined by [Kevin Ashton](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Ashton) in 1999, envisioning a future where physical objects could be seamlessly integrated into the internet through sensors. Today, IoT encompasses any device capable of interacting with its physical surroundingsâ€”either by collecting data through **sensors** or influencing the real world via **actuators**. These devices are typically connected to other devices, local networks, or the broader Internet, creating a vast network of interconnected 'things'.

> [!note] Defining IoT's Core
> At its heart, IoT connects the digital realm with the physical world. It's about empowering inanimate objects with the ability to perceive, process, and respond to their environment, making them 'smart'.

### Beyond the Device: Cloud and Edge Computing in IoT

IoT is far more than just the physical gadgets. It's a holistic technology ecosystem that includes sophisticated cloud-based services designed to process the immense volumes of sensor data generated. These cloud platforms enable advanced analytics, machine learning, and centralized control, allowing for complex decision-making and remote management of IoT devices. Furthermore, the ecosystem incorporates **edge devices**â€”components that perform data processing and decision-making locally, often without requiring constant internet connectivity. These edge devices, frequently leveraging AI models trained in the cloud, can respond to sensor data in real-time, proving crucial for latency-sensitive applications or environments with limited connectivity.

### The Data Tsunami: Fueling IoT's Growth

IoT is one of the fastest-growing technological fields, characterized by an unprecedented explosion of data. By the end of 2020, an estimated 30 billion IoT devices were actively deployed and connected globally. Looking ahead, projections suggest that by 2025, IoT devices will be responsible for generating nearly 80 zettabytes (or 80 trillion gigabytes) of data. This sheer volume underscores the critical importance of understanding how to effectively gather, process, and utilize this information.

![A graph showing active IoT devices over time, with an upward trend from under 5 billion in 2015 to over 30 billion in 2025](https://microsoft.github.io/IoT-For-Beginners/images/connected-iot-devices.svg)

> [!info] The Unused Data Conundrum
> While IoT generates massive amounts of data, a significant portion often goes unused or is discarded. This can be due to poor data quality, lack of infrastructure for processing, privacy concerns, or simply an inability to extract meaningful insights from raw information. Successful IoT development hinges on intelligently identifying, collecting, and leveraging only the most valuable data.

Mastering IoT means understanding the entire data lifecycle: what data to collect, how to efficiently gather it, how to derive actionable insights, and finally, how to translate those insights into real-world interactions.

## Dissecting the \\"Things\\": Sensors, Actuators, and Device Types

At the core of the **T** in IoT are the 'Things' themselvesâ€”the devices that interact directly with the physical world. These interactions occur primarily through sensors and actuators.

### Sensors: The Eyes and Ears of IoT

**Sensors** are the fundamental components that enable IoT devices to perceive their environment. They convert various physical phenomena into measurable electrical signals. Think of them as the 'eyes' and 'ears' of your IoT system, constantly gathering information. Examples include:

*   **Temperature sensors:** Measure ambient heat or the temperature of objects.
*   **Humidity sensors:** Detect moisture levels in the air or soil.
*   **Proximity sensors:** Determine the presence or absence of an object without physical contact.
*   **Accelerometers and Gyroscopes:** Measure motion, orientation, and vibration.
*   **Light sensors:** Detect light intensity.
*   **Pressure sensors:** Measure force applied over an area.
*   **GPS modules:** Pinpoint location.

### Actuators: Bringing IoT to Life

Conversely, **actuators** are the components that allow IoT devices to perform actions in the physical world. They convert electrical signals back into physical movements or changes, acting as the 'muscles' of your IoT system. Common examples include:

*   **LEDs:** For visual indicators or lighting.
*   **Relays:** Electrically operated switches that can control higher power circuits.
*   **Motors:** For movement, such as in robotic arms or smart blinds.
*   **Solenoids:** Electromagnets used to create linear motion, often for locking mechanisms.
*   **Pumps:** For fluid control, like in automated irrigation systems.
*   **Speakers/Buzzers:** For audible alerts or feedback.

### Choosing Your IoT Brain: Microcontrollers vs. Single-Board Computers

For production or commercial IoT products, devices are often custom-designed for specific tasks, optimizing for size, power consumption, and ruggedness. However, for developers, learners, or prototype creation, **developer kits** are the go-to choice. These general-purpose IoT devices are equipped with features specifically for experimentation and debugging, such as external pins for connecting peripherals.

Developer kits broadly fall into two main categories:

#### Microcontrollers (MCUs): The Efficient Specialists

A microcontroller (MCU) is a compact, integrated circuit designed to perform a limited number of very specific tasks. It's essentially a small computer on a single chip, comprising:

*   ðŸ§  **One or more Central Processing Units (CPUs):** The 'brain' that executes your program instructions.
*   ðŸ’¾ **Memory (RAM and program memory):** For storing your code, data, and variables.
*   ðŸ”Œ **Programmable Input/Output (I/O) connections:** To interface with external sensors and actuators.

MCUs are renowned for their low cost (some production units are as cheap as US$0.03, with developer kits starting around US$4) and energy efficiency. They are ideal for embedded systems where a dedicated task needs to be performed reliably with minimal resources. Unlike general-purpose computers, you typically cannot connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to an MCU for everyday computing.

Many MCU developer kits, like the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) from [Seeed Studios](https://www.seeedstudio.com/) (around US$30), come with integrated sensors, actuators, and wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi), simplifying initial setup. They are usually programmed in **C/C++**, offering granular control over hardware.

> [!tip] MCU vs. MCU: A Common Pitfall
> When searching online, be mindful that 'MCU' can also refer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Always specify 'microcontroller unit' or 'microcontroller' for relevant results.

#### Single-Board Computers (SBCs): The Versatile Workhorses

A single-board computer (SBC) is a complete computer built on a single, compact circuit board. These devices boast specifications akin to a desktop or laptop PC, capable of running a full operating system, yet they are significantly smaller, more power-efficient, and substantially more affordable.

%% image of a Raspberry Pi 4 %% 
![A Raspberry Pi 4](https://microsoft.github.io/IoT-For-Beginners/images/raspberry-pi-4.jpg)

> [!note] The Raspberry Pi: A Popular SBC Choice
> The Raspberry Pi is arguably the most popular single-board computer, widely adopted for its versatility and robust community support.

Like microcontrollers, SBCs feature a CPU, memory, and I/O pins (often referred to as GPIO - General Purpose Input/Output). However, they differentiate themselves with additional features such as:

*   **Graphics chips:** For connecting external monitors.
*   **Audio outputs:** For sound.
*   **USB ports:** To connect standard peripherals like keyboards, mice, webcams, and external storage.
*   **Storage:** Programs and operating systems are typically stored on SD cards or hard drives, not embedded memory chips.

SBCs are full-fledged computers, offering the flexibility to be programmed in virtually any language. For IoT applications, **Python** is a particularly popular choice due to its readability, extensive libraries, and rapid prototyping capabilities.

> [!info] SBCs as Mini-PCs with GPIO
> You can conceptualize a single-board computer as a scaled-down, more energy-efficient version of your desktop or laptop, with the added capability of GPIO pins to directly interface with sensors and actuators.

## Embarking on Your IoT Development Journey

All subsequent lessons in an IoT curriculum typically involve hands-on assignments where you'll interact with the physical world and communicate with cloud services. You'll typically have choices regarding your development hardware and software stack.
