# Hello readers 👋

Doanh is my name, this is the place to record what happened in my real brain. What happened was my **knowledge, experience and experience** about my journey to build a career in the field of **information technology oriented to the Japanese market**. Especially **IoT (Internet of Things),** has been becoming a thriving trend of this country of the rising sun.

This is a field that I used to think was unrealistic to pursue because it involves **the Japanese language**. One of the world's most difficult languages to learn! But ***"hate it, heaven give it"***, my major in university is this field! The reason is that I like IT, but the pure IT industry is not eligible to pass, so I accept that it could not be a better choice at that time

In the learning journey, I realized that there are many things that ***"seem unrelated but unthinkably related"*** to my career. They indirectly support, motivate and strengthen their belief in the path they have chosen, which is also a lifeline choice when their career encounters difficulties. Therefore, I will also share them with all readers to see that our brains, which are a wonder of the world, can contain and use what we have learned to a terrible extent!

***Anyway, welcome to my brain!***
